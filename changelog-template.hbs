## User Friendly Enums by @RyoTune 

Thanks to @RyoTune  it is now possible to give 'enums' user friendly named in mod configs; 
before you had:

```csharp
public enum SampleEnum
{
    NoOpinion,
    Sucks,
    IsMediocre,
    IsOk,
    IsCool,
    ILoveIt,
}
```

Which produced

With the new addition, it's now possible to add user friendly names to each configuration item:

```csharp
public enum SampleEnum
{
    [Display(Name = "No Opinion ü§∑")]
    NoOpinion,
    [Display(Name = "It's Sucks! üëé")]
    Sucks,
    [Display(Name = "It's mediocre üòê")]
    IsMediocre,
    [Display(Name = "It's okay! üëç")]
    IsOk,
    [Display(Name = "It's cool! üòé")]
    IsCool,
    [Display(Name = "I Love It!!! ‚ù§Ô∏èüî•")]
    ILoveIt,
}
```

## Explicit Item Ordering by @RyoTune 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/466ffc2c-ed19-4ec7-bf05-43d054fbd0e4)

```csharp
[Display(Order = 0)]
public int OrderFirst { get; set; }

[Display(Order = 1)]
public int OrderSecond { get; set; }

[Display(Order = 2)]
public int OrderThird { get; set; }
```

Lower order means items come first.

Do note that this is inverted from the original PR; so if you originally wrote your mod against [Reloaded II.5 ReMIX](https://github.com/RyoTune/Reloaded-II.5) fork, it may be the opposite to what you expected.

## Launcher Error Reporting by @TheBestAstroNOT + @Sewer56

Launcher errors now give you the option to print the error details to a text file.

Hopefully this is a bit friendlier for end users ü§û.

## Improved Missing Loader Error by @TheBestAstroNOT + @Sewer56 

Sometimes users do the following:

- Use the `Deploy ASI Loader` feature in Reloaded, and then uninstall Reloaded.
- Use the `Deploy ASI Loader` feature and then move the Reloaded folder.

The error message for missing Mod Loader DLL was updated to account for these situations.
The user is now explicitly let known how to resolve the error.
