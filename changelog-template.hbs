# 1.29.2: Miscellaneous Things

Just a few low effort fixes and miscellany. As usual, Reloaded-II is on life support while I spend
the next years building the next best thing - if you want features, please contribute!

## Fix: Better Error Handling for Bad Update Files

Previously, if someone uploaded a corrupted `Sewer56.Update.Metadata.json` file to GameBanana or GitHub,
Reloaded would crash. Now it handles these errors gracefully instead of crashing.

Might add UI in future.

## Fix: Unnecessary Runtime Downloads

![](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45795e1b-c922-44e9-9134-60fe18b27f29)

Fixed an issue where the dependency installer was requesting unnecessary .NET runtime downloads.
The problem was that the installer wasn't filtering out the `Mods` folder, so it tried to install
runtimes that mods were built with, even though all mods use the loader's runtime.

Now it only installs truly needed dependencies.

[This happened because in the last release the in-launcher dependency installer was updated to use
the same code as `Setup.exe`; and this was a small oversight in the migration.]
